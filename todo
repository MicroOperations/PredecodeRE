- check if predecode cache shared between cores
- check if predecode cache flushed on priv boundary
- re its layout, lookup algorithm, eviction policies

# findings

coherency:
- Cache evictions can cause predecode cache evictions
- Tlb evictions can cause predecode cache evictions 
- Disabling caching in cr0 control reg disables predecode cache
- The predecode cache isnt  coherent with the l1i cache nor the itlb

predecode cache utilisation:

- When an instruction with an lcp is being predecoded the processor looks up the predecode 
  cache, and uses the data retreived to predict relevant data (such as instruction boundaries, 
  type of instruction etc)

- During my tests I found that only instructions with lcp's were  
  utilising the predecode cache

- Only when a misprediction occurs the predecode cache is updated accordingly 

- Instructions which don't utilise the predecode cache do not cause the predecode cache to
  be updated
