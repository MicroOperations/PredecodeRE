- check if predecode cache shared between cores
- check if predecode cache flushed on priv boundary
- re its layout

findings:

- cache evictions can cause predecode cache evictions
- tlb evictions can cause predecode cache evictions 
- disabling caching in cr0 control reg disables predecode cache
- the predecode cache isnt completely coherent with the l1i cache
- predecode cache is used to predict predecode data (instruction boundaries, type of instruction etc),
  seems to be much more effective with lcp's
