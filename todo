- check tlb evictions cause predecode cache evictions
- self modifying code effect on predecode cache + predecode cache coherency with l1i
- check if predecode cache shared between cores
- check if predecode cache flushed on priv boundary

findings:

- cache flushes can cause predecode cache flushes
- disabling caching in cr0 control reg disables predecode cache
- predecode cache used to predict predecode data (instruction boundaries, type of instruction etc)
